# TODO:
# The story can be broken into tasks, scoped, and sized.
#  Means seemed overloaded or vague like using general action term such as manage improve
#  bisa di broken ke :
# Vague verbs (see, manage).
# Scope unbounded (future days, all content).
# Outcomes too broad or subjective (so I can prepare).
# Dependencies not identified (e.g., “notify in Slack” without clarifying Slack integration).
# Missing measurable acceptance criteria.
